# Hi! I'm Sergei (he/him). I'm a software engineer.

I'm also an Engineering Manager passionate about success of the people I work with. Father and Partner, Bookworm ðŸ“š,
student of complexity, long-distance trekker â›°. Based in Rio de Janeiro(ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·), before Berlin(ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª), and Kyiv(ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦).

I'm currently building [staticoon](https://staticoon.com) - a bot that automates refactoring and improves your codebase over time.
Before - [GetYourGuide](https://inside.getyourguide.com/) and other startups for the last 10 years.

## Where to find me
* My [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sergei_tweets) DMs are always open
* Otherwise, I'm on [Github](https://github.com/sergekukharev/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergekukharev/), and [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63030634-sergei-kukharev).

## How do I pronounce your name?
Most of the people call me Sergei.

I don't mind if you mispronounce it. My name is coming from Latin `Sergius`. So you can call me Sergei, Sergii, Serge, Sergio, or even Serginho.

My last name is harder. Kukhariev is pronounced something like "cu-ha-r'ev", where "r'" is a softer r.

gets it right.
