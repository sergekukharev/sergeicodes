# Hi! I'm Sergei

I'm an Engineering Manager passionate about people I work with. Father and Partner, Software Engineer 👨‍💻, Bookworm 📚,
student of complexity. 

This is my blog. It's [open source](https://github.com/sergekukharev/sergeicodes). 

I'm currently building [staticoon](https://staticoon.com) - a bot that automates refactoring and improves your codebase overtime.

## How do I pronounce your name? 
I really don't care. My name is latin based. So you can call me Sergei, Sergii, Serge, Sergio, or even Serginho. 

Most of the people call me Sergei.

My last name is harder. Kukhariev is pronounced something like "cu-ha-r'ev", where "r'" is a softer r.

gets it right.d
