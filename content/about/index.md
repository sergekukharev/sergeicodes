# Hi! I'm Sergei (he/him). I'm a software engineer.

I also had some years of experience as an Engineering Manager passionate about success of the people I work with. 
Father and Partner, Bookworm ðŸ“š, student of complexity, long-distance trekker â›°. 
Based in SÃ£o Paulo(ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·), before Rio de Janeiro(ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·), Berlin(ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª), and Kyiv(ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦).

I'm currently working as a Staff Engineer at [Mixmax](https://www.mixmax.com/), where my goal is to transition the 
company away from our distributed monolith and simplify our stack and developer experience while decreasing lead times 
on shipping great features to our customers.

Ex:
- [staticoon](https://staticoon.com) - a bot that automates refactoring and improves your codebase over time. I'm a
  proud founder of this failed startup.
- [GetYourGuide](https://inside.getyourguide.com/) 
- and some other startups for the last 12 years.

## Where to find me
* My [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sergei_tweets) DMs are always open, although with recent drama I'm not sure for how
  long you can find me there.
* Otherwise, I'm on [Github](https://github.com/sergekukharev/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergekukharev/), 
  and [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63030634-sergei-kukharev).

## How do I pronounce your name?
Most of the people call me Sergei.

I don't mind if you mispronounce it. My name is coming from Latin `Sergius`. So you can call me Sergei, Sergii, Serge, Sergio, or even Serginho.

My last name is harder. Kukhariev is pronounced something like "cu-ha-r'ev", where "r'" is a softer r.

gets it right.
